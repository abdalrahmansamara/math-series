Description: Welcome to series, a functionality that builds fibonacci and lucas series using recursion , then test fibonacci and lucas series

Problem Domain: you should create a functionality that:
* creates fibonacci series, then test it for multiple inputs
* creates locus series, then test it for multiple inputs
* creates sum_series series, that has two optional values to determine if we should use fibonacci or lucas series then test it for multiple inputs

Start time : 1:00 pm

Finish time: 2:16 pm

Notes: i learned a new feature for optional arguments while solving this lab, it's cool!
